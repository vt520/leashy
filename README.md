# Leashy - Tools for Jerk Free Photography
Leashy is a _useful_ phone retention system that is designed to quickly slip over your phone (and it's case) and tether it to your person.

> Note We're still in the design phase, and are actively building phone gauges and soliciting measurements.

## How it works
Leashy is a set of easy printing 3D printed yokes for easily looping a retaining cord around your phone with it's case on; holding it with a [friction hitch][friction-hitch] so that the phone cannot slip from the loop when sharply tugged, but is easily released with gentle force.

## Making a Leashy

### Required Materials

- Access to a 3D Printer
- Approximately 20g of PLA Filament, 
- 48 inches (1.225m) 160lb paracord

### Recommended Tools

- Calipers
- Square

### Determine your Case Size

- Check the [Case Files][case-files] to see if the community has already measured your case
- Use a pair of calipers to carefully measure the width and depth (two smallest dimensions) of your phone case

### Getting the Model

If you found your Case in the [Case Files][case-files], and your printer is well adjusted, use the community tested models first.

Otherwise if the recommended files do not work for you, or if your case isn't currently available, you can [Export][onshape-export] a model directly from OnShape by following the instructions given for your desired [type](types/) of Leashy.

### Slicing your Model

We recommend slicing your Leashy using the following settings:

- .4mm Nozzle Diameter
- 3 Solid Layers
- 0.5mm minimum shell thickness
- 2 Vertical Shells
- Support on Build Plate Only
- 50% Cubic Infill

### Threading and Tying

Thread the paracord through your Leashy yoke so that the free ends exit through the knot relief area.

Select one free end, and use it to tie a [Zip Tie Knot][friction-hitch] around the other free end so that it will lay inside the knot relief.

Insert your phone into the yoke, and loop the cord tightly over, tidying your [Friction Hitch][friction-hitch] until it is fully tightened.

Using the other free end, tie a [bowline][bowline] or similar fixed loop that can slip snugly over your hand, yet loosely on your wrist, with a short (1 to 3in, 2.5 to 7.5cm) between the loop and the hitch.

### Loosening your Leashy

To remove your phone, pull the outside line that exits from the yoke opposite from your wrist loop.  It may resist a little at first, then should slide freely allowing you to unloop the cord from your phone.

## Using a Leashy

### Keep it with you

The best camera is the one you have with you, and the same applied to your accessories.  Leashy is intended to sit in your desk drawer, purse, car, or your key hook next to your front door.

### Inserting and Tightening

Every time you use your Leashy, fully insert your phone into the yoke and tighten the loop over the top of your phone.

Ensure the cord follows the guide channels on the sides of your Leashy yoke so that it will not obstruct your front or back camera.

Place your fixed loop over your hand and around your wrist, then pull the cord fully taut to secure the phone.

You are now ready to begin filming.

### When your phone is grabbed

1. **Do Not Pull Continuously Using The Yoke**<br/>While the friction hitch will resist pulling, it may slip under continued effort.
2. Resist firmly, then let go of the phone<br/>This will firmly set the friction hitch so the phone will remain in the yoke.
3. Spread your hand fully, or grab the cord if you are able, and pull using the fixed loop<br/>Pulling using your wrist allows you exert significantly more force retrieving phone.
4. If you need to be released from your phone, simply allow it to slip over your hand<br/>Sometimes it's not worth winning a prize you don't want.

### Practice makes perfect

Until you are comfortable, you should practice with a friend both tightening and loosening your phone from your Leashy, but also practice resisting having your phone taken and jerking it back.

### Care and maintenance

You should regularly inspect your Leashy to make sure that 
- It is still solidly constructed (no cracks) 
- There are pronounced layer lines within the cord guides
- The friction hitch is neat and well laid within the knot relief
- The free ends of the cord are &gt; 3cm long

When the friction hitch is messy or when the free ends &lt; 3cm, you should untie and retie both knots.  If the guide channels are smoothed or the yoke is cracked it has worn out and should be replaced.
